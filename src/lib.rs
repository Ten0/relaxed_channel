//! # relaxed_channel
//!
//! Wrapper around [`async_channel`], more performant on heavy pipelines
//!
//! ## The issue
//!
//! When readers (holding the [`Receiver`]) are faster than writers (holding the [`Sender`]), the channel's length will
//! always be low. Normally, after reading a message, a reader task would encounter an empty channel when
//! attempting to read the next message, and immediately set itself waiting for a wake up when the next message is sent.
//! This implies that upon sending the next message, the writer has to dedicate a significant portion of its time
//! marking the receiving tasks for wake up in the tokio runtime.
//!
//! (The portion of time is significant when the pipeline gets heavy, around millions of messages per second.)
//!
//! The effect increases as the number of readers increases (because there are more readers to wake up), so the more
//! parallelism is required on the receiving end, the slower the writer(s) get.
//!
//! ## Solution
//!
//! When reading a message and encountering an empty channel:
//!
//! - Channel is empty => this means we are processing faster than the writers can produce data.
//! - Let's not cost time to the reader, and instead of marking ourselves for wake up, just sleep for e.g. 100ms.
//! - After 100ms, do a regular [`Receiver::recv()`] to check for a message, and only now mark ourselves for wake up if
//!   there is still no message available.
//!
//! This implies that each reader will only have to be woken up by a writer at most once every 100ms.
//!
//! This crate provides [`RelaxedReceiver`], wrapping the regular [`async_channel::Receiver`] to add this behavior.
//!
//! **Note that this design is such that all readers may be sleeping at the same time for 100ms, so in order for this to
//! not slow the reader down, the channel's capacity must be large enough to hold more messages than may arrive during
//! that time.**
